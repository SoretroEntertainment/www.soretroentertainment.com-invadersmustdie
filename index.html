	<br>Very rarely I make music reviews, so let me break it down for you. I don't know if I should categorize it 
as an article, or as a review, because if I might continue writing more... you know what, they're not reviews. 
Review is an object critique solely based on the individual's experiences and complaints. A critique that
is fully subjective on its own, whether you agree with it or not, unless the object is illegal and/or atrocious.
That said, I'm not planning to review drugs because I'm not a faggot. This "review" is more of a ranking, 
all I have to do is just rate the songs from 0 to 10. But not so fast, I don't just give an album ten out of ten 
and throw it to the trash can. I don't do that nerdy shit here, because let me ask you this. What's the purpose of music? 
Enjoying it. That's the only fucking thing it matters. I pay attention to the music industry as little as possible 
because it is so fucked you won't be able to enjoy music anymore because of it. More artists get exposed for pedophilia 
and their fans make 20 minute reviews on an album and still give it 5 fucking stars. No, I'll rank music my way.
You see, good musicians know, that if people are going to listen to their music, or shall we say their magnum opus, 
they're going to have to make it relistenable. Any music that isn't relistenable has no value at all and 
it will never be touched again. It doesn't matter that it should give you a certain vibe about a real life event 
or a traumatic experience they went through that you'd have to feel bad for them. If they want to share pain 
through music, that's fine, I respect that, but it doesn't make the song relistenable and barely critics' excuse to 
write some retarded bullshit about it. OR... simply being it a pathetic attempt like 
that fucking loop thing in IGOR¹, so faggots will force you to listen to it. What I'm saying is, 
sickass beats  and swag vocals is everything that's needed for good music. If none of that is in the album, 
or in the singles, they blow cocks. And guess what? My most favourite artist group happens to be The Prodigy. 
Almost their entire discography is dope, ecstatic and most importantly, relistenable. 
That's why I picked my personal favourite, Invaders Must Die. although I was thinking of other 
variants like Music for the Jilted Generation or Fat of the Land, maybe even Always Outnumbered 
Never Outgunned. But I picked one that's most relistenable for my taste. 
Here, my review on Invaders Must Die.
</center>
<p>
<br>#1 - Invaders Must Die
<small><br>I've been listening to it and it's a 
<br>fucking bomb. Holy shit I don't think 
<br>there are any drum & bass singles to 
<br>top this one out. It's the music 
<br>that should be illegal to remix.</small>
<br>Verdict - Infinite replayability.
<p>
<br>#2 - Omen
<small><br>Not a big fan of mainstream hits 
<br>but surely it is fun to listen to.</small>
<br>Verdict - Good, but won't bet on 
<br>being this much relistenable.
<p>
<br>#3 - Thunder
<small><br>This isn't Imagine Dragons, 
<br>take your believer ass back 
<br>to hell where it belongs. 
<br>Oh, I like the song by the way.</small>
<br>Verdict - Slightly relistenable but it's cool as fuck.
<p>
<br>#4 - Colours
<small><br>Geniunely one of my favourites, hell yeah.</small>
<br>Verdict - I had this playing 
<br>on my now deleted Spacehey profile, 
<br>I deleted it because website's filled 
<br>with mental illness². Banger song.
<p>
<br>#5 - Take Me to the Hospital
<small><br>Catchy as fuck, I love it. Yuh.</small>
<br>Verdict - Ta-ta-take me to the... HOSPITAL.
<p>
<br>#6 - Warrior's Dance
<small><br>...I can't fucking believe this exists. 
<br>This, this would be an orgy for clubs, 
<br>or this song could actually result into an orgy 
<br>in a whorehouse but what do I know? 
<br>I've never been in one (except for a whorehouse) 
<br>but either way it's just fucking AMAZING.</small>
<br>Verdict - Relistenable and a blast.
<p>
<br>#7 - Run with the Wolves
<small><br>Probably has the same 
<br>energy as Diesel Power, maybe. 
<br>But Diesel Power is a lot more replayable.</small>
<br>Verdict - It's fucking good.
<p>
<br>#8 - Omen Reprise
<small><br>It's an interlude.</small>
<br>Verdict - Sorry, but interludes don't 
<br>count, unless they're really relistenable.
<p>
<br>#9 - World's On Fire
<small><br>Oh it's on fire alright. Excuse me, 
<br>anyways, I fucking love this song so much. 
<br>It's surprising not many people listen to it.</small>
<br>Verdict - Why aren't you dead?
<p>
<br>#10 - Pirahna
<small><br>PIRAHNA, PA-PA-PIRAHNA!</small>
<br>Verdict - Do I even have to say anything 
<br>to prove you just how superb it is?
<p>
<br>#11 - Stand Up
<small><br>This album, and this closure... 
<br>wow. What a fucking journey. 
<br>It's... a fucking masterpiece. Hands down.</small>
<br>Verdict - Infinite replayability.
<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

<br>Conclusion: If there was a better album than Music for the Jilted Generation, 
it's definitely Invaders Must Die. Like... this is a MUST LISTEN. 
Never listened to The Prodigy? Do it fucking now. But what if you 
don't want to listen this album? A better question is, why the fuck 
do you even bother reading this article? Kudos to The Prodigy who 
have invented music, they certainly did because others who have 
done music, could never match their swag. That shit was and is swag 
and anybody who's already been familiar and in love with the product is swag.
